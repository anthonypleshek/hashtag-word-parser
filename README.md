# Hashtag Parser
Enter a hashtag, handle, or any string of characters, and receive all combinations of words that can be created with that string of characters without changing the order of the characters. Limited to 20 characters because efficiency was not part of the proof of concept.

Currently using a list of words generated using http://app.aspell.net/create
